Somewhere needs a “Pickup Locations” info. Like where you can meet your instructor. I have an extensive list of all the marinas, restaurants, parks and activities on lake travis so that could almost form an index of all to do on the lake. Including this kind of detail would bring more traffic to the site as it becomes an information hub as well.

I could use google to create a custom map that has all these places showing and maybe we could embed it?

** here are some notes from each page that should be added.

Front page



Under the how it works: “Chartering a boat?” or “Don’t have a boat?” link to our affiliates page. Here will go links to local boat rental companies who I will establish a relationship to feed them renters that will then hire a coach as a package deal. This may get changed as things progress. Contacts: Keep Austin wet, ATX Boat rentals…

Have an expanding drop down style FAQ at the bottom

This could be a google style data entry for the evaluation. It will be kinda like when you rent skis/snowboard from Christy sports.
