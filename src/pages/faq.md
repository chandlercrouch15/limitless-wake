**Q: “Does Limitless provide a boat?”**
No, only lessons. But we can help you book a boat rental and lesson package through our affiliates.

**Q: “How long is a lesson?”**
Lessons are 1 hour minimum of in water time. There is no saving 20 minutes. You pay for the hour. We suggest filling the hour with up to 3 different riders as most folks do begin to get tired after 20 minutes of wakesurfing or wakeboarding.

If you are new to watersports, proper instruction can make or break the experience. With Limitless, we are determined that anyone can learn to ride and we will prove it.</p>

**Q: “Are there rainchecks?”**
Limitless will provide a voucher for your lesson if you are unable to complete it due to weather circumstances.

**Q: “What if I have to cancel my lesson?”**
The cancelation policy is as follows: cancellation notice 24 hours or more before your lesson receives a 100% refund. Less than 24 hour cancelation notice receives 85% refund.

Lessons with Limitless is a per hour basis. Afterwards, if you wish to have your captain your boat while you enjoy the lake that rate is an additional $55.00 per hour.
