  - question: 'Does Limitless provide a boat?'
    answer: No, only lessons. But we can help you book a boat rental and lesson package through our affiliates.
  - question: How long is a lesson?.
    answer: Lessons are 1 hour minimum of in water time. There is no saving 20 minutes. You pay for the hour. We suggest filling the hour with up to 3 different riders as most folks do begin to get tired after 20 minutes of wakesurfing or wakeboarding.

    answer: Limitless will provide a voucher for your lesson if you are unable to complete it due to weather circumstances.

    answer: 'The cancelation policy is as follows: cancellation notice 24 hours or more before your lesson receives a 100% refund. Less than 24 hour cancelation notice receives 85% refund.'
  - question: Will limitless captain our boat?
    answer: Lessons with Limitless is a per hour basis. Afterwards, if you wish for us to captain your boat while you enjoy the lake that rate is an additional $55.00 per hour.
