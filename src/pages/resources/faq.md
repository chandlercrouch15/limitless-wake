  - answer: >-
      Lessons are 1 hour minimum of in water time. There is no saving 20
      minutes. You pay for the hour. We suggest filling the hour with up to 3
      different riders as most folks do begin to get tired after 20 minutes of
      wakesurfing or wakeboarding.
    question: How long is a lesson?.
  - answer: >-
      If you are new to watersports, proper instruction can make or break the
      experience. With Limitless, we are determined that anyone can learn to
      ride and we will prove it.

      Limitless will provide a voucher for your lesson if you are unable to
      complete it due to weather circumstances.

      The cancelation policy is as follows: cancellation notice 24 hours or more
      before your lesson receives a 100% refund. Less than 24 hour cancelation
      notice receives 85% refund.
