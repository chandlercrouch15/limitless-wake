          <h1>FAQ</h1>
          <h5>Q: “Does Limitless provide a boat?”</h5><br />
          <p>No, only lessons. But we can help you book a boat rental and lesson package through our affiliates.</p>
          <br/>
          <h5>Q: “How long is a lesson?”</h5><br />
          <p>Lessons are 1 hour minimum of in water time. There is no saving 20 minutes. You pay for the hour. We suggest filling the hour with up to 3 different riders as most folks do begin to get tired after 20 minutes of wakesurfing or wakeboarding.</p>
          <br/>
          <h5>Q: “Why should we use Limitless for our next lake day?”</h5><br />
          <p>If you are new to watersports, proper instruction can make or break the experience. With Limitless, we are determined that anyone can learn to ride and we will prove it.</p>
          <br/>
          <h5>Q: “Are there rainchecks?”</h5><br />
          <p>Limitless will provide a voucher for your lesson if you are unable to complete it due to weather circumstances.</p>
          <br/>
          <h5>Q: “What if I have to cancel my lesson?”</h5><br />
          <p>The cancelation policy is as follows: cancelation notice 24 hours or more before your lesson receives a 100% refund. Less than 24 hour cancelation notice receives 85% refund.</p>
          <br/>
          <h5>Q:  “Will limitless captain our boat?”</h5><br />
          <p>Lessons with Limitless is a per hour basis. Afterwards, if you wish for us to captain your boat while you enjoy the lake that rate is an additional $55.00 per hour.</p>
