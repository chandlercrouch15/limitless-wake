        <p>Lessons are 1 hour minimum of in water time. There is no saving 20 minutes. You pay for the hour. We suggest filling the hour with up to 3 different riders as most folks do begin to get tired after 20 minutes of wakesurfing or wakeboarding.</p>

        <p>The cancelation policy is as follows: cancellation notice 24 hours or more before your lesson receives a 100% refund. Less than 24 hour cancelation notice receives 85% refund.</p>
