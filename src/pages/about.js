    <p>Born on Lake Travis in Austin, Texas, Limitless Wake Owner, Chandler, knows the value of time spent out on the lake. Since junior high Chandler was volunteering to coach and teach youths at local wakeboard camps like One Wakeboard camp in Austin, TX.

In college at Texas A&M University, Chandler helped organize and manage a competitive boat wakeboard team that now has finished among the top teams in the nation for the last several years. In 2016, he won the individual national championship for the intermediate level class. He operated a local 2.0 wakeboard cable park and taught riders from beginner to advance on how to improve their skills quickly and safely.

Following his graduation, Chandler followed his passion for watersports to the mecca capital: Orlando, Florida.
